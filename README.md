# AT Protocol - Identity

A small library to support [Identity](https://atproto.com/guides/identity)
for the AT Protocol.

## Status

Crate in early development.

## To Do

- [ ] Focus on guidelines <https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/> to
    make the API real cool.
- [ ] Fix what still doesn't work when parsing `Handle`s.
- [ ] See what might be of future use (e.g. `did:web`, DID URI, DID Documents,
    representation of public keys).
- [ ] Write useful, clear and short crate documentation.
- [ ] Test/use with the rest of own AT Protocol/Bluesky crates and with `atrium`.
